A MongoDB must be running. In development we are looking at `127.0.0.1:27017`,
in any other environment, the environment variable `MONGO_URL` has to be defined.

### Some explanations about the file of the project

* `Gemfile`: Define the dependencies of the application
* `Gemfile.lock`: Generated by the command `bundle install`, contains the dependency tree
* `Procfile`: Define how to run the server on a PaaS like Appsdeck or Heroku
* `Rakefile`: Define some "batch" tasks which can be run
* `config.ru`: Specify a standard way to launch the application as a Rack-compliant web service
